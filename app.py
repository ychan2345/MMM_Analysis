    You are an experienced marketing data scientist. The user has uploaded an image containing output from a Robyn marketing mix model.
    Please read the image carefully and pay extra attention to all numerical details. Verify every number; if there is any uncertainty or ambiguity, clearly note your assumptions.
    Depending on the image title, please tailor your analysis as follows:

    --------------------------------------------------
    If the image is titled "One-pager for Model", interpret the key insights from the charts provided and address the following:

    Overall Model Performance:
    - Evaluate key metrics such as Adjusted RÂ², NRMSE, and DECOMP.RSSD.
    - Identify signs of model robustness or potential overfitting/underfitting from the Fitted vs. Residual plot.

    Channel Contributions and Efficiency:
    - Analyze the Response Decomposition Waterfall by Predictor to highlight the channels driving positive or negative incremental responses.
    - Assess the Share of Total Spend, Effect & ROAS chart to determine spending efficiency.
    - Compare channel-level ROI/ROAS in the In-cluster Bootstrapped ROAS plot and highlight any channels with low returns.

    Time Dynamics and Carryover Effects:
    - Use the Weibull PDF Adstock plot to interpret the flexible rate over time for each channel.
    - Examine the Immediate vs. Carryover Response Percentage plot to understand the distribution of immediate vs. long-term effects.

    Spend and Response Relationships:
    - Interpret the Response Curves and Mean Spends by Channel to identify diminishing returns and spending thresholds.
    - Discuss how well spend and response align for each channel.

    Actionable Recommendations:
    - Identify opportunities to reallocate budget toward high-ROAS channels and reduce spending on underperforming ones.
    - Suggest improvements in spend allocation based on observed diminishing returns.
    - Highlight any adjustments to model assumptions that could improve future efforts.

    Summary and Next Steps:
    - Provide a concise summary of the modelâ€™s performance, strengths, and limitations.
    - Suggest actionable next steps for optimizing the media mix strategy.
    - If any channelâ€™s ROI or ROAS is significantly below expectations, recommend delaying further investment until additional data is available or improvements are identified.

    --------------------------------------------------
    If the image is titled "Budget Allocation Onepager for Model", please address these points:


    Budget Allocation per Paid Media:
    Extract the table data for 'Budget Allocation per Paid Media Variable per Month'. The table contains three sections:
    1. **Initial** (Left Table)
    2. **Bounded** (Middle Table)
    3. **Bounded x3** (Right Table)

    The first column represents the **Paid Media** names. Extract the **abs.mean spend ($)**, **mean spend%**, **mean response%**, **mean ROAS**, and **mROAS** values and format the table as follows:

    Please extract the numerical values from the image and format them into a structured table, ensuring that the paid media names match those shown in the image. The table should be formatted as follows:  

    | Paid Media      | Scenario    | abs.mean spend | mean spend% | mean response% | mean ROAS | mROAS |
    |-----------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|----------------|-----------|-------|
    | [Media Name 1]  | Initial     | [Value]        | [Value]     | [Value]        | [Value]   | [Value]  |
    | [Media Name 2]  | Initial     | [Value]        | [Value]     | [Value]        | [Value]   | [Value]  |
    | [Media Name 1]  | Bounded     | [Value]        | [Value]     | [Value]        | [Value]   | [Value]  |
    | [Media Name 2]  | Bounded     | [Value]        | [Value]     | [Value]        | [Value]   | [Value]  |
    | [Media Name 1]  | Bounded x3  | [Value]        | [Value]     | [Value]        | [Value]   | [Value]  |
    | [Media Name 2]  | Bounded x3  | [Value]        | [Value]     | [Value]        | [Value]   | [Value]  |

    ### Instructions:
    - Extract each row **horizontally from left to right**.
    - Maintain the **Paid Media names exactly** as they appear in the image.
    - Ensure the extracted values are structured in the table above.

    If any values are unclear, estimate based on the image and note any assumptions made.

    1. Critical Budget Allocation Insights & Business Priorities
       - Evaluate the current distribution of the marketing budget across channels based on the Roybn Model.
       - Identify channels with high or low incremental response and ROAS to determine if they are under- or over-invested.
       - For budget adjustments (e.g., scenarios of 5% and 10% reallocation), clearly outline which channels meet the performance criteria for additional investment. Provide specific dollar figures (e.g., "$10,000 for Channel A") to illustrate recommended investment amounts and maximize ROI.

    2. Detailed Channel Performance & ROI Analysis
       - Provide a side-by-side comparison of channel-specific ROAS, incremental response, and bootstrapped confidence intervals.
       - Assess whether the current spend is proportionate to the observed incremental impact.
       - If certain channels show unfavorable ROI/ROAS, recommend holding off on further investment until more data is available or targeted strategies are implemented. Include example figures to quantify the proposed hold or delay.

    3. Additional Budget Investment Strategy
       - Determine which channel(s) offer the best potential for improved ROI with additional budget allocation.
       - Use data-driven insights to rank channels and highlight the most critical opportunities for growth.
       - Explicitly provide recommended dollar amounts (e.g., "Allocate an extra $10,000 to Channel A and $8,500 to Channel B") based on the modelâ€™s sensitivity analysis and performance metrics.

    4. Final Model Evaluation & Strategic Recommendations
       - Evaluate whether the Roybn Model meets industry standards and business needs, summarizing strengths and weaknesses.
       - Provide actionable recommendations to refine both the model and the media mix strategy.
       - Ensure all numerical details and assumptions are clearly validated.

    5. Structured Budget Allocation Table
       - Present a table that outlines the recommended spend per channel and the expected ROI.
       - If no channel meets the threshold for a strong ROIâ€”even with extra budgetâ€”state that further investment is not advisable and recommend alternative actions (e.g., collecting more data or adjusting campaign strategies).

    Table Format:
    | Channel       | Recommended Spend ($) | Expected ROI (%) |
    |---------------|-----------------------|------------------|
    | Channel 1     | $5K                   | 15%              |
    | Channel 2     | $3.5K                 | 12%              |
    | Channel 3     | $0.8K                 | 18%              |

    Note: The "Budget Allocation per Media" table in the image is arranged horizontally (channels are rows and metrics are columns). Please ignore the Paid Media channel.

- Evaluate key performance metrics such as Adjusted RÂ², NRMSE, and DECOMP.RSSD to assess model accuracy and reliability.
- Examine the Fitted vs. Residual plot to identify any signs of overfitting or underfitting.
- Determine whether the model's predictive power is sufficient for strategic decisions or if further refinement is needed.

Channel Contributions and Carryover Effects:
- Assess the Share of Total Spend, Effect & ROAS chart to evaluate spending efficiency across channels.
- Use the Weibull PDF Adstock plot to analyze how advertising effectiveness changes over time.
- Examine the Immediate vs. Carryover Response Percentage plot to understand the distribution of immediate and long-term effects.

Actionable Recommendations:
- Identify opportunities to reallocate budget toward high-ROAS channels and reduce spending on underperforming ones.
- Provide recommendations for strategic spend adjustments based on diminishing returns and response curves.
- Suggest model refinements to improve future forecasts.

Summary and Next Steps:
- Provide a concise summary of the modelâ€™s performance, strengths, and limitations.
- Offer actionable next steps, such as collecting additional data or testing alternative predictors.
- Clearly state whether the modelâ€™s insights support current marketing investment decisions or if further improvements are required.
