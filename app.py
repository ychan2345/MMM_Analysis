        "If the image is titled \"One-pager for Model\", interpret the key insights from the charts provided and address the following:\n\n"
        "Overall Model Performance:\n"
        "- Evaluate key metrics such as Adjusted RÂ², NRMSE, and DECOMP.RSSD.\n"
        "- Identify signs of model robustness or potential overfitting/underfitting from the Fitted vs. Residual plot.\n\n"
        "Channel Contributions and Efficiency:\n"
        "- Analyze the Response Decomposition Waterfall by Predictor to highlight the channels driving positive or negative incremental responses.\n"
        "- Assess the Share of Total Spend, Effect & ROAS chart to determine spending efficiency.\n"

        "- Use the Weibull PDF Adstock plot to interpret the flexible rate over time for each channel.\n"
        "- Examine the Immediate vs. Carryover Response Percentage plot to understand the distribution of immediate vs. long-term effects.\n\n"

        "   - Evaluate the current distribution of the marketing budget across channels based on the Roybn Model.\n"
        "   - Identify channels with high or low incremental response and ROAS to determine if they are under- or over-invested.\n"

Provide specific dollar figures (e.g., \"$10,000 for Channel A\") to illustrate recommended investment amounts and maximize ROI.\n\n"

        "   - Provide a side-by-side comparison of channel-specific ROAS, incremental response, and bootstrapped confidence intervals.\n"
        "   - Assess whether the current spend is proportionate to the observed incremental impact.\n"
        "   - If certain channels show unfavorable ROI/ROAS, recommend holding off on further investment until more data is available or targeted strategies are implemented. Include example figures to quantify the proposed hold or delay.\n\n"
        "3. Additional Budget Investment Strategy\n"
        "   - Determine which channel(s) offer the best potential for improved ROI with additional budget allocation.\n"
        "   - Use data-driven insights to rank channels and highlight the most critical opportunities for growth.\n"
        "   - Explicitly provide recommended dollar amounts (e.g., \"Allocate an extra $10,000 to Channel A and $8,500 to Channel B\") based on the modelâ€™s sensitivity analysis and performance metrics.\n\n"
        "4. Final Model Evaluation & Strategic Recommendations\n"

        "   - Provide actionable recommendations to refine both the model and the media mix strategy.\n"
        "   - Ensure all numerical details and assumptions are clearly validated.\n\n"
        "5. Structured Budget Allocation Table\n"
        "   - Present a table that outlines the recommended spend per channel and the expected ROI.\n"
        "   - If no channel meets the threshold for a strong ROIâ€”even with extra budgetâ€”state that further investment is not advisable and recommend alternative actions (e.g., collecting more data or adjusting campaign strategies).\n\n"
