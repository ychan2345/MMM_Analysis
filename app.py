Please analyze and interpret the following aspects:

Overall Model Performance and Quality
- Assess the reported RÂ², NRMSE, and any other goodness-of-fit metrics
- Indicate whether the model appears robust, what the residual plot suggests, and any signs of overfitting or underfitting

Key Drivers and Contributions
- Explain which channels or predictors are contributing most to incremental sales/response (e.g., from the decomposition waterfall)
- Summarize how each channel's ROI compares and whether the results make intuitive sense

Immediate vs. Carryover Effects
- Evaluate the distribution of short-term (immediate) vs. long-term (carryover) responses across channels and what that implies for budgeting or planning

Recommendations
- Suggest how to optimize media spend based on ROI and diminishing returns (e.g., referencing the response curves)
- Identify any under- or over-invested channels
- Provide any next steps for improving the model (e.g., adding data sources, adjusting hyperparameters, validating assumptions)

Finally, please conclude with:
- A rating of whether this is a 'good' model overall by typical marketing analytics standards
- Specific, actionable recommendations on how to refine both the model and the media mix strategy"""
